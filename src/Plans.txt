#### NEW STRATEGY

GLOBAL
    private(public_table, key)
        Key MUST be the private class table.
        First param may be the public class or public instance table.
        Throws an IllegalAccessException if the key is wrong.
        Returns the same instance, but different table of public_table
            This table is empty and has the highest access.
            Calling this can access private, public, or protected members.            
    protected(public_table, key)
        Key MUST be the private class table.
CLASS
    Takes in reference to the superclass table
    Returns public_class, public, private, and protected static tables

CONSTRUCTOR
    Default constructor is placed into the private table.
    Returns public_instance, public, private, and protected tables

EXCEPTION
    IllegalAccessException
        Used for Class when a user uses the invalid key.

#### OLD STRATEGY

Class Module
returns Class Table, protected members, public members
parameter subclass Class Table

*create table for public members
*create table for protected members
static maps Class Tables to their protected members
static maps Instance tables to their current default table

class should query the superclasses protected table
__index of protected table redirects to superclass protected table
if __index for the protected tables returns nil,
    redirects search to the default table.
    
class should define a default member table
hierarchy, default table member should be initialized:
    saves reference to previous hierarchy name
    returns "classname[" .. hierarchy() .. "]"
__index of the default member table redirects to the public table

TODO: At the moment, all class members are static. This is a little strange?

class should query the superclasses public table
__index of public table redirects to the superclasses public table
__index of the public table for the apex class throws an exception
__index of the public table for non-apex classes direct to the superclass

constructor:
    * checks to make sure that the instance is an instance of the superclass
    * __tostring redirects to the self["__tostring"]
    * __call redirects to the self["__call"]
    * __index redirects to static map[instance] ==> default table
    * __newindex leads to an exception
